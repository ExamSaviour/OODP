# OO DESIGN PATTERNS LAB
- Course Code : BCGL504
- Credits : 1

## Course objectives:
* To introduce students to the fundamental principles and concepts of design patterns and their role in object-oriented software development.
* To equip students with the skills to identify and apply the most appropriate design patterns to solve common software design problems.
* To develop the ability to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different design patterns in real-world applications.
* To provide hands-on experience in implementing various design patterns using object-oriented programming languages.

## Lab Experiments

1. Design and implement ShapeFactory class that generates different types of Shape
objects (Circle, Square, Rectangle) based on input parameters using Factory Design
Pattern.

2. Design and Implement an AbstractFactory class to create families of related or
dependent objects with respect to decathlon store without specifying their concrete
classes using Abstract Factory.

3. Design and implement a complex object like a House using a step-by-step Builder
pattern, allowing different representations of the house (wooden, brick, etc.).

4. Design and Implement to Extend a Coffee object with dynamic features (e.g., milk,
sugar, whipped cream) using Decorators.

5. Design and Implement a Logger class ensuring a single instance throughout the
application

6. Design and implement an Adapter Pattern for a Music System.

7. Design and Implement an Observer pattern for a news agency to notify subscribers
of updates.

8. Design and Implement a Fa√ßade pattern for home theatre system.

9. Design and Implement a Template Method for Document Processing (word, pdf,
excel)

10. Design and Implement weather monitoring system that notifies multiple display
devices whenever the weather conditions change that follows the Observer Design
Pattern.

11. Design and Implement a Proxy pattern to control access to an object (e.g., a protected
resource or remote service).

12. Design and Implement a Mediator pattern to manage communication between a set
of objects (e.g., chat room with multiple participants).
